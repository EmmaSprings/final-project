Questions:

1. I added a new object in the Notes Model:

when: {
    type: String,
    required: true
}

but when I test with postman (just added a random string)
it's not saved in the database. It ignored the "when" completely.

2. how to send date object from react-datepicker npm package to MongoDB?

3. Modifying the date data object that has a default of Date.now()?
